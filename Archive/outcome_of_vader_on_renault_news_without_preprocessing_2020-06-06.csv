', '– American football fail ', 'GRIDIRON GOES UNDER. American football fans have lost a rebooted post-Super Bowl springtime league almost as soon as it started. The parent company of the XFL filed for bankruptcy on Monday, a month after the coronavirus forced it to blow the whistle halfway through its first season. XFL had non-pandemic problems, not least the poor track record of previous attempts to establish non-NFL leagues. Its viewers also quickly halved from the roughly 3 million who tuned in for the first week’s games in February.  ', 'The National Football League and entities that control college football have better finances and far sturdier support. But the fate of their upcoming seasons also depends on regulations surrounding large gatherings and post-crisis consumer behavior changes. Longer-standing concerns about safety remain, too. As for the XFL, owner and World Wrestling Entertainment Chairman Vince McMahon is hoping to sell it. That may end up a bust. (By Anna Szymanski) ', 'BALANCE SHEET BLUES. Borrowers are rushing to claim their unused bank credit lines, and in large amounts. JPMorgan said on Tuesday that clients claimed $55 billion of undrawn loans in March. At Wells Fargo the number was a potentially inconvenient $80 billion. The Federal Reserve has forbidden the bank from growing its balance sheet as punishment for past bad behavior. Customers’ dash for cash has put it above its limit of just over $1.9 trillion. ', 'Fortunately, Wells Fargo has some leeway: The cap is measured against six-month daily averages. And the Fed has given new boss Charlie Scharf some wiggle room. He can pitch in with the federal bailout of U.S. companies, so long as the bank gives away any fees. But it’s no wonder Scharf is itching to have the cap removed altogether. Standing by some Wells Fargo clients may mean leaving others to fend for themselves. (By John Foley) ', 'SWEETEST TABOO. Renault has offloaded its main joint venture in China just as rival carmakers expect the market to recover from a coronavirus-induced lockdown. The embattled French automaker, whose shares have fallen 56% this year, never really made a dent in the market: The venture sold less than 20,000 cars last year, a fraction of Renault’s 3.75 million global deliveries. Local partner Dongfeng Motor will assume Renault’s share of the loss-making alliance and stop producing Renault-branded vehicles. ', 'It makes sense for acting Chief Executive Clotilde Delbos to cut superfluous losses as she prepares to welcome successor Luca de Meo from Volkswagen. She has already pledged to find 2 billion euros in “no taboo” savings over the next three years. Renault will retain separate Chinese joint ventures in electric cars and vans. But the exit will heighten its dependence on Europe, which already accounts for over half of vehicle sales. (By Christopher Thompson) ', 'TAKING CREDIT. It is getting rough and tumble in mergers and acquisitions. Carlyle just threw a one-two punch at Pioneer Credit, an Australian debt collector that it agreed to buy in December. First, the private equity firm threatened to withdraw A$142 million ($91 million) of funding because of alleged defaults, which Pioneer denies. Then, Carlyle cited breaches and material adverse changes to its A$120 million buyout. It gave its target five days to sort things out. ', 'With all the doubt, Pioneer’s shares tumbled 56% on Tuesday. Pioneer reckons Carlyle is just using the pandemic to squeeze it. That wouldn’t be surprising, even considering Pioneer’s many troubles. As the financial crisis unfolded over a decade ago, several private equity firms tried to back out of deals. And in 2016 Carlyle itself haggled down the original $8 billion price tag for data storage firm Veritas after banks struggled to syndicate the buyout debt in a tough market. Pioneer says it’ll fight back, but it may have a limited amount of leverage. (By Jeffrey Goldfarb) ', 'PINT HALF-EMPTY. Anheuser-Busch InBev halved its dividend and delayed its annual general meeting because of uncertainty caused by the coronavirus crisis. This will save the world’s biggest brewer around $1.1 billion, a small contribution to bringing down its $95.5 billion debt pile. ', 'The good news for AB InBev Chief Executive Carlos Brito is that people are boozing more at home to get through this difficult time: sales have spiked in the United States, AB InBev’s biggest market. But with bars and restaurants shut across much of the world, the overall outlook is dire but uncertain. Even after cutting the dividend, the group is likely way off Brito’s target of bringing net debt below 4 times EBITDA this year: analyst forecasts compiled by Refinitiv put it at 4.9 times. Still, there’s scope for more radical action if the crisis endures. Delaying the payment to June 11 from early May gives Brito time to further trim the dividend if necessary. (By Dasha Afanasieva) ', 'ROSE-TINTED SWAPS. Whoever said central banks were out of ammunition? The perceived riskiness of European companies has fallen sharply in recent days, according to the credit default swap market, boosted by the Federal Reserve’s plans to buy junk-rated debt and hopes the coronavirus crisis is easing. ', 'The Markit iTraxx Crossover index of swaps based on debt issued by European sub-investment grade companies has fallen back to around 460 basis points in morning trading on Tuesday, down from a recent peak of over 700 basis points, according to Refinitiv data. The current spread would be enough to compensate for a default rate of about 8% over the next year, according to Breakingviews calculations. That’s roughly in line with S&P’s forecasts, but far below its more pessimistic scenario of an 11% failure rate. Defaults exceeded 12% in both of the last two credit cycles.

The parent company of the XFL filed for bankruptcy on Monday, a month after the coronavirus forced it to blow the whistle halfway through its first season. XFL had non-pandemic problems, not least the poor track record of previous attempts to establish non-NFL leagues. Its viewers also quickly halved from the roughly 3 million who tuned in for the first week’s games in February.  ', 'The National Football League and entities that control college football have better finances and far sturdier support.

Borrowers are rushing to claim their unused bank credit lines, and in large amounts. JPMorgan said on Tuesday that clients claimed $55 billion of undrawn loans in March. At Wells Fargo the number was a potentially inconvenient $80 billion. The Federal Reserve has forbidden the bank from growing its balance sheet as punishment for past bad behavior. Customers’ dash for cash has put it above its limit of just over $1.9 trillion. ', 'Fortunately, Wells Fargo has some leeway: The cap is measured against six-month daily averages. And the Fed has given new boss Charlie Scharf some wiggle room. He can pitch in with the federal bailout of U.S. companies, so long as the bank gives away any fees. But it’s no wonder Scharf is itching to have the cap removed altogether. Standing by some Wells Fargo clients may mean leaving others to fend for themselves. (By John Foley) ', 'SWEETEST TABOO. Renault has offloaded its main joint venture in China just as rival carmakers expect the market to recover from a coronavirus-induced lockdown. The embattled French automaker, whose shares have fallen 56% this year, never really made a dent in the market: The venture sold less than 20,000 cars last year, a fraction of Renault’s 3.75 million global deliveries.

', 'It makes sense for acting Chief Executive Clotilde Delbos to cut superfluous losses as she prepares to welcome successor Luca de Meo from Volkswagen.

But the exit will heighten its dependence on Europe, which already accounts for over half of vehicle sales. (By Christopher Thompson) ', 'TAKING CREDIT. It is getting rough and tumble in mergers and acquisitions. Carlyle just threw a one-two punch at Pioneer Credit, an Australian debt collector that it agreed to buy in December. First, the private equity firm threatened to withdraw A$142 million ($91 million) of funding because of alleged defaults, which Pioneer denies. Then, Carlyle cited breaches and material adverse changes to its A$120 million buyout. It gave its target five days to sort things out. ', 'With all the doubt, Pioneer’s shares tumbled 56% on Tuesday. Pioneer reckons Carlyle is just using the pandemic to squeeze it. That wouldn’t be surprising, even considering Pioneer’s many troubles. As the financial crisis unfolded over a decade ago, several private equity firms tried to back out of deals. And in 2016 Carlyle itself haggled down the original $8 billion price tag for data storage firm Veritas after banks struggled to syndicate the buyout debt in a tough market. Pioneer says it’ll fight back, but it may have a limited amount of leverage. (By Jeffrey Goldfarb) ', 'PINT HALF-EMPTY. Anheuser-Busch InBev halved its dividend and delayed its annual general meeting because of uncertainty caused by the coronavirus crisis. This will save the world’s biggest brewer around $1.1 billion, a small contribution to bringing down its $95.5 billion debt pile. ', 'The good news for AB InBev Chief Executive Carlos Brito is that people are boozing more at home to get through this difficult time: sales have spiked in the United States, AB InBev’s biggest market. But with bars and restaurants shut across much of the world, the overall outlook is dire but uncertain. Even after cutting the dividend, the group is likely way off Brito’s target of bringing net debt below 4 times EBITDA this year: analyst forecasts compiled by Refinitiv put it at 4.9 times. Still, there’s scope for more radical action if the crisis endures. Delaying the payment to June 11 from early May gives Brito time to further trim the dividend if necessary.

The perceived riskiness of European companies has fallen sharply in recent days, according to the credit default swap market, boosted by the Federal Reserve’s plans to buy junk-rated debt and hopes the coronavirus crisis is easing. ', 'The Markit iTraxx Crossover index of swaps based on debt issued by European sub-investment grade companies has fallen back to around 460 basis points in morning trading on Tuesday, down from a recent peak of over 700 basis points, according to Refinitiv data.

Even after cutting the dividend, the group is likely way off Brito’s target of bringing net debt below 4 times EBITDA this year: analyst forecasts compiled by Refinitiv put it at 4.9 times.

The parent company of the XFL filed for bankruptcy on Monday, a month after the coronavirus forced it to blow the whistle halfway through its first season. XFL had non-pandemic problems, not least the poor track record of previous attempts to establish non-NFL leagues. Its viewers also quickly halved from the roughly 3 million who tuned in for the first week’s games in February.

Borrowers are rushing to claim their unused bank credit lines, and in large amounts. JPMorgan said on Tuesday that clients claimed $55 billion of undrawn loans in March. At Wells Fargo the number was a potentially inconvenient $80 billion. The Federal Reserve has forbidden the bank from growing its balance sheet as punishment for past bad behavior. Customers’ dash for cash has put it above its limit of just over $1.9 trillion. ', 'Fortunately, Wells Fargo has some leeway: The cap is measured against six-month daily averages.

First, the private equity firm threatened to withdraw A$142 million ($91 million) of funding because of alleged defaults, which Pioneer denies. Then, Carlyle cited breaches and material adverse changes to its A$120 million buyout. It gave its target five days to sort things out. ', 'With all the doubt, Pioneer’s shares tumbled 56% on Tuesday. Pioneer reckons Carlyle is just using the pandemic to squeeze it. That wouldn’t be surprising, even considering Pioneer’s many troubles. As the financial crisis unfolded over a decade ago, several private equity firms tried to back out of deals. And in 2016 Carlyle itself haggled down the original $8 billion price tag for data storage firm Veritas after banks struggled to syndicate the buyout debt in a tough market. Pioneer says it’ll fight back, but it may have a limited amount of leverage. (By Jeffrey Goldfarb) ', 'PINT HALF-EMPTY. Anheuser-Busch InBev halved its dividend and delayed its annual general meeting because of uncertainty caused by the coronavirus crisis.

', 'The good news for AB InBev Chief Executive Carlos Brito is that people are boozing more at home to get through this difficult time: sales have spiked in the United States, AB InBev’s biggest market. But with bars and restaurants shut across much of the world, the overall outlook is dire but uncertain. Even after cutting the dividend, the group is likely way off Brito’s target of bringing net debt below 4 times EBITDA this year: analyst forecasts compiled by Refinitiv put it at 4.9 times. Still, there’s scope for more radical action if the crisis endures. Delaying the payment to June 11 from early May gives Brito time to further trim the dividend if necessary.

Even after cutting the dividend, the group is likely way off Brito’s target of bringing net debt below 4 times EBITDA this year: analyst forecasts compiled by Refinitiv put it at 4.9 times.

', '– American football fail ', 'GRIDIRON GOES UNDER. American football fans have lost a rebooted post-Super Bowl springtime league almost as soon as it started. The parent company of the XFL filed for bankruptcy on Monday, a month after the coronavirus forced it to blow the whistle halfway through its first season. XFL had non-pandemic problems, not least the poor track record of previous attempts to establish non-NFL leagues. Its viewers also quickly halved from the roughly 3 million who tuned in for the first week’s games in February.  ', 'The National Football League and entities that control college football have better finances and far sturdier support. But the fate of their upcoming seasons also depends on regulations surrounding large gatherings and post-crisis consumer behavior changes. Longer-standing concerns about safety remain, too. As for the XFL, owner and World Wrestling Entertainment Chairman Vince McMahon is hoping to sell it. That may end up a bust. (By Anna Szymanski) ', 'BALANCE SHEET BLUES. Borrowers are rushing to claim their unused bank credit lines, and in large amounts. JPMorgan said on Tuesday that clients claimed $55 billion of undrawn loans in March. At Wells Fargo the number was a potentially inconvenient $80 billion. The Federal Reserve has forbidden the bank from growing its balance sheet as punishment for past bad behavior. Customers’ dash for cash has put it above its limit of just over $1.9 trillion. ', 'Fortunately, Wells Fargo has some leeway: The cap is measured against six-month daily averages. And the Fed has given new boss Charlie Scharf some wiggle room. He can pitch in with the federal bailout of U.S. companies, so long as the bank gives away any fees. But it’s no wonder Scharf is itching to have the cap removed altogether. Standing by some Wells Fargo clients may mean leaving others to fend for themselves. (By John Foley) ', 'SWEETEST TABOO. Renault has offloaded its main joint venture in China just as rival carmakers expect the market to recover from a coronavirus-induced lockdown. The embattled French automaker, whose shares have fallen 56% this year, never really made a dent in the market: The venture sold less than 20,000 cars last year, a fraction of Renault’s 3.75 million global deliveries. Local partner Dongfeng Motor will assume Renault’s share of the loss-making alliance and stop producing Renault-branded vehicles. ', 'It makes sense for acting Chief Executive Clotilde Delbos to cut superfluous losses as she prepares to welcome successor Luca de Meo from Volkswagen. She has already pledged to find 2 billion euros in “no taboo” savings over the next three years. Renault will retain separate Chinese joint ventures in electric cars and vans. But the exit will heighten its dependence on Europe, which already accounts for over half of vehicle sales. (By Christopher Thompson) ', 'TAKING CREDIT. It is getting rough and tumble in mergers and acquisitions. Carlyle just threw a one-two punch at Pioneer Credit, an Australian debt collector that it agreed to buy in December. First, the private equity firm threatened to withdraw A$142 million ($91 million) of funding because of alleged defaults, which Pioneer denies. Then, Carlyle cited breaches and material adverse changes to its A$120 million buyout. It gave its target five days to sort things out. ', 'With all the doubt, Pioneer’s shares tumbled 56% on Tuesday. Pioneer reckons Carlyle is just using the pandemic to squeeze it. That wouldn’t be surprising, even considering Pioneer’s many troubles. As the financial crisis unfolded over a decade ago, several private equity firms tried to back out of deals. And in 2016 Carlyle itself haggled down the original $8 billion price tag for data storage firm Veritas after banks struggled to syndicate the buyout debt in a tough market. Pioneer says it’ll fight back, but it may have a limited amount of leverage. (By Jeffrey Goldfarb) ', 'PINT HALF-EMPTY. Anheuser-Busch InBev halved its dividend and delayed its annual general meeting because of uncertainty caused by the coronavirus crisis. This will save the world’s biggest brewer around $1.1 billion, a small contribution to bringing down its $95.5 billion debt pile. ', 'The good news for AB InBev Chief Executive Carlos Brito is that people are boozing more at home to get through this difficult time: sales have spiked in the United States, AB InBev’s biggest market. But with bars and restaurants shut across much of the world, the overall outlook is dire but uncertain. Even after cutting the dividend, the group is likely way off Brito’s target of bringing net debt below 4 times EBITDA this year: analyst forecasts compiled by Refinitiv put it at 4.9 times. Still, there’s scope for more radical action if the crisis endures. Delaying the payment to June 11 from early May gives Brito time to further trim the dividend if necessary. (By Dasha Afanasieva) ', 'ROSE-TINTED SWAPS. Whoever said central banks were out of ammunition? The perceived riskiness of European companies has fallen sharply in recent days, according to the credit default swap market, boosted by the Federal Reserve’s plans to buy junk-rated debt and hopes the coronavirus crisis is easing. ', 'The Markit iTraxx Crossover index of swaps based on debt issued by European sub-investment grade companies has fallen back to around 460 basis points in morning trading on Tuesday, down from a recent peak of over 700 basis points, according to Refinitiv data. The current spread would be enough to compensate for a default rate of about 8% over the next year, according to Breakingviews calculations. That’s roughly in line with S&P’s forecasts, but far below its more pessimistic scenario of an 11% failure rate. Defaults exceeded 12% in both of the last two credit cycles.

', 'Faced with a slump in demand that has been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic, the French carmaker detailed plans on Friday to find 2 billion euros ($2.22 billion) in savings over the next three years. ', '“We thought too big in terms of sales,” said interim Chief Executive Clotilde Delbos, adding the company was “coming back to its bases” after investing and spending too much in recent years. ', 'Renault was under pressure even before COVID-19 hit, posting its first loss in a decade in 2019, and has said nothing would be “taboo” as it reviews its business.      ', 'It plans to trim its global capacity to 3.3 million vehicles in 2024 from 4 million now, focusing on its most profitable models and areas such as electric cars while freezing manufacturing expansion in countries like Romania. ', 'Renault, like its Japanese alliance partner Nissan, is rowing back on an aggressive expansion plan pursued by Ghosn, its former boss-turned-fugitive, who is wanted on charges of financial misconduct in Tokyo. Ghosn denies the charges.  ', '“The mindset has completely changed. The previous line was volumes and sales and being the first on the podium,” Delbos said. “We’re not looking to be on top of the world, what we want is a sustainable and profitable company.” ', 'The company, due to bring ex-Volkswagen (', ') executive Luca de Meo on board as CEO in July, said it would cut costs by reducing the number of subcontractors in areas such as engineering and the number of components it uses, as well as shrinking gearbox manufacturing worldwide. ', 'Delbos ruled out the need for a rights issue, saying Renault was close to sealing a 5 billion-euro credit line guaranteed by the French government. ', 'Renault shares were down 5.3% by 1223 GMT, the worst-performing stock on France’s blue-chip index.   ', 'Renault, which is 15% owned by the French state, faces the most sensitive restructuring measures in its home country, which will shoulder almost a third of the global job cuts and faces potential plant closures. ', 'The carmaker said it was in talks with unions. Six sites out of Renault’s 14 plants in France - including a component factory in Brittany and the Dieppe factory where the group’s Alpine cars are made - will be under review, though most changes would take effect after 2022, Delbos said.  ', 'Some of the six plants like the one in Flins, close to Paris, where it makes its electric Zoe models, could cease to assemble cars and centre on recycling activities instead, the company said.  ', 'The government has said it will not sign off on the state-backed loan until management and unions conclude talks over jobs and factories in France. It is seeking more clarity on how some big factories will be reorganised and further guarantees on jobs before it gives the green light, according to a source familiar with the matter.  ', 'In all, just under 10% of Renault’s global workforce will be affected by layoffs, and restructuring measures will cost 1.2 billion euros. There will be about 4,600 job cuts in France, though Renault said it would prioritise employment transfers, voluntary departures and retirement schemes.  ', 'French unions expressed frustration.

', 'Now, with carmakers around the world reeling from the pandemic, the partners are planning to overhaul an alliance that largely failed to convert its global scale into a competitive advantage beyond the joint procurement of parts. ', 'Both struggling carmakers are set to announce mid-term restructuring plans this week that will serve as a peace treaty designed to resolve the long-standing tensions, the five people familiar with the overhaul told Reuters.  ', '“After the rain, the earth hardens,” said one senior Nissan source, citing a popular Japanese proverb that means relationships become stronger after a period of strife. ', 'All five sources within the alliance, which also includes Mitsubishi Motors Corp (', '), declined to be named because they are not authorised to speak with media. ', 'Nissan and Renault are each planning substantial restructuring and cost cuts that could affect tens of thousands of jobs, with the Japanese company to announce its measures on May 28 and its French partner likely to follow the next day. ', 'Before that, Mitsubishi, Nissan and Renault are holding a joint news conference on May 27 during which they are expected to outline the philosophy behind their new “leader-follower” approach to the alliance. ', 'The sources said the companies were unlikely to disclose many details at the events this week of how the new approach will be used to share costs as the companies were still working on specific projects. ', 'However, the crisis at both carmakers has accelerated efforts to resolve the disagreements that have stymied collaboration and cost-sharing in technology and product development for five years, the sources said. ', 'Mitsubishi, Nissan and Renault all declined to comment officially about alliance plans. ', '‘LEADER-FOLLOWER’ ', 'The alliance has steadily ramped up output over the years, delivering over 10 million vehicles for the first time in 2017, the first full year after Mitsubishi joined the partnership.  ', 'But persistent quibbles over sharing the costs of innovation and new vehicle development soured relations and stalled plans to forge an even tighter alliance. ', 'Nissan executives believe their engineers are substantially more productive than their Renault colleagues and the way the French carmaker proposed to combine technology and product development did not properly account for Nissan’s intellectual property, three of the sources said.  ', '“Nissan engineers on average produced 40% more than their Renault counterparts in a given amount of time spent on a job,” one insider told Reuters in January. ', 'After his arrest in 2018 in Tokyo on charges of financial misconduct, former alliance head Ghosn said his detention was part of a plot by Nissan executives to bring him down and block any merger. ', 'Earlier this year, relations looked strained to a point where the 21-year alliance was at risk of collapse. ', 'However, the turnaround plans due are now likely to be combined to forge what the sources described as a more equitable way of sharing technology and resources, while preserving the distinctiveness of the alliance brands. ', 'Nissan Chief Operating Officer Ashwani Gupta and Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique\xa0Senard are both key advocates of the new approach that they’re calling a “leader-follower” system, the sources told Reuters. ', 'The plan is for one company to lead the development of a type of vehicle or technology with the other following, taking a page out of the play-book Gupta used to revive Renault’s commercial vehicle business, as well as reinvigorate Nissan’s. ', 'When he was in charge of the French business, Nissan used Renault’s vehicle architectures as the building blocks for its city delivery vans while Nissan in turn provided the Renault group with technology for pickup trucks. ', 'A test of the new approach could come in a several places around the world, such as how Renault and Nissan work together in Europe and perhaps South America, as well as how Nissan and Mitsubishi cooperate in Southeast Asia and Japan.  ', 'Under the new working relationship, Nissan could take the lead in Europe on crossover sport-utility vehicles (SUVs), while operating as a “follower” in commercial vans and small city cars, using versions produced by Renault, the sources said. ', 'Nissan’s factory in Sunderland in the United Kingdom is of particular importance, they said. ', 'Renault and Nissan are planning to turn the assembly plant into a hub for sport utility vehicles such as Nissan’s Qashqai and Juke, and potentially their Renault counterparts, the Kadjar and Captur. The companies are working on the plans, though it’s not clear when a final decision will be made, the sources said. ', 'Whether Renault vehicles could be built profitably at the plant is unclear, given the uncertainty over tariffs as Britain leaves the European Union, according to one of the sources.  ', '“It should be a pure economic transaction, but it’s also likely a political decision, too,” he said. ', 'In the Philippines, Mitsubishi will likely help make cars for Nissan as it already has a plant there while the two will beef up cooperation in Japan’s micro mini car business, which makes up about half the country’s passenger car market. ', 'The latest effort to salvage the Renault-Nissan alliance comes at a time of rising global economic nationalism and protectionism that represent a risk to the partnership. ', 'But for now, the new approach means the two companies will sideline any discussion of a complete merger, the sources said. Renault owns a 43.4% controlling stake in Nissan, which owns non-voting 15% stake in the French carmaker. ', '“Will merger talk be revived in the future? No one knows.

', 'The companies have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic just as they were trying to rework their partnership following the arrest of its chief architect, Carlos Ghosn, who had been pushing for a merger despite stiff resistance from Nissan. ', 'The new plan, which entails cutting the alliance’s vehicle ranges by a fifth, pooling manufacturing by region and capitalising on joint designs, is meant to serve as a peace treaty, sources have told Reuters. ', '“We don’t need a merger to be efficient,” Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard told a joint news conference.  ', 'He also said existing ties with Germany’s Daimler (', '), which owns Mercedes-Benz, could be strengthened and that he hoped to make an announcement in the coming weeks. ', 'Renault and Nissan were among the weakest global automakers going into the coronavirus crisis and had lacked a clear plan for using their alliance to emerge from the slump and share the burden of investing in electric vehicles and other technology.  ', 'Rivals such as Peugeot (', ') and Fiat Chrysler (', '), have been pushing ahead with plans to share costs and designs while the two biggest carmakers, Volkswagen (', ') and Toyota (', '), already operate as single units. ', 'Renault shares, which have been depressed by the tensions with Nissan and the French carmaker’s first loss in a decade in 2019, surged by almost 20% following Wednesday’s announcements.

', 'Senard said that would help cut costs, with joint savings on future compact sports-utility vehicles (SUVs) coming to 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion). ', 'In Brazil, for example, the new approach means the alliance will go from making six models on four platforms - or underlying vehicle architectures - to seven models on one platform. ', 'A tighter design and development process at the alliance, whose best-known cars include the Renault Clio compact hatchback, the Nissan Rogue crossover SUV and the Mitsubishi Outlander SUV, would reduce it total number of models by 20% by 2025 from well over 80 now. ', 'Some analysts pointed to potential problems, however, saying the three companies remained locked in a partnership while some larger rivals were not constrained by structural limitations. ', '“The way this plan has been designed is to avoid stepping on each others’ toes, but there could be some efficiency losses, as there are boundaries they have to respect,” said Chris Richter, senior research analyst at brokerage CLSA. ', 'Renault, Nissan and junior partner Mitsubishi, which joined the alliance in 2016, have clashed previously due to differences in corporate cultures and opposing views over structures.

Nissan has resisted proposals for a full-blown merger as executives felt Renault was not paying its fair share for the engineering work it did in Japan.

Renault and Nissan, which is set to post a net loss in its latest fiscal year, are now hoping to get ahead of rivals in areas like electric vehicles.

They will now use a shared design for the upper body of each company’s cars, which would then be personalised to reflect the individual brands.

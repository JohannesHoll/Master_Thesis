', 'Faced with a slump in demand that has been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic, the French carmaker detailed plans on Friday to find 2 billion euros ($2.22 billion) in savings over the next three years. ', '“We thought too big in terms of sales,” said interim Chief Executive Clotilde Delbos, adding the company was “coming back to its bases” after investing and spending too much in recent years. ', 'Renault was under pressure even before COVID-19 hit, posting its first loss in a decade in 2019, and has said nothing would be “taboo” as it reviews its business.      ', 'It plans to trim its global capacity to 3.3 million vehicles in 2024 from 4 million now, focusing on its most profitable models and areas such as electric cars while freezing manufacturing expansion in countries like Romania. ', 'Renault, like its Japanese alliance partner Nissan, is rowing back on an aggressive expansion plan pursued by Ghosn, its former boss-turned-fugitive, who is wanted on charges of financial misconduct in Tokyo. Ghosn denies the charges.  ', '“The mindset has completely changed. The previous line was volumes and sales and being the first on the podium,” Delbos said. “We’re not looking to be on top of the world, what we want is a sustainable and profitable company.” ', 'The company, due to bring ex-Volkswagen (', ') executive Luca de Meo on board as CEO in July, said it would cut costs by reducing the number of subcontractors in areas such as engineering and the number of components it uses, as well as shrinking gearbox manufacturing worldwide.

', 'Renault shares were down 5.3% by 1223 GMT, the worst-performing stock on France’s blue-chip index.   ', 'Renault, which is 15% owned by the French state, faces the most sensitive restructuring measures in its home country, which will shoulder almost a third of the global job cuts and faces potential plant closures. ', 'The carmaker said it was in talks with unions. Six sites out of Renault’s 14 plants in France - including a component factory in Brittany and the Dieppe factory where the group’s Alpine cars are made - will be under review, though most changes would take effect after 2022, Delbos said.  ', 'Some of the six plants like the one in Flins, close to Paris, where it makes its electric Zoe models, could cease to assemble cars and centre on recycling activities instead, the company said.  ', 'The government has said it will not sign off on the state-backed loan until management and unions conclude talks over jobs and factories in France. It is seeking more clarity on how some big factories will be reorganised and further guarantees on jobs before it gives the green light, according to a source familiar with the matter.  ', 'In all, just under 10% of Renault’s global workforce will be affected by layoffs, and restructuring measures will cost 1.2 billion euros. There will be about 4,600 job cuts in France, though Renault said it would prioritise employment transfers, voluntary departures and retirement schemes.  ', 'French unions expressed frustration. ', '“This plan is unbalanced, at the expense of French activities,” the moderate CFDT union said on Friday, adding that other countries had been less affected.

', 'Now, with carmakers around the world reeling from the pandemic, the partners are planning to overhaul an alliance that largely failed to convert its global scale into a competitive advantage beyond the joint procurement of parts. ', 'Both struggling carmakers are set to announce mid-term restructuring plans this week that will serve as a peace treaty designed to resolve the long-standing tensions, the five people familiar with the overhaul told Reuters.  ', '“After the rain, the earth hardens,” said one senior Nissan source, citing a popular Japanese proverb that means relationships become stronger after a period of strife. ', 'All five sources within the alliance, which also includes Mitsubishi Motors Corp (', '), declined to be named because they are not authorised to speak with media. ', 'Nissan and Renault are each planning substantial restructuring and cost cuts that could affect tens of thousands of jobs, with the Japanese company to announce its measures on May 28 and its French partner likely to follow the next day. ', 'Before that, Mitsubishi, Nissan and Renault are holding a joint news conference on May 27 during which they are expected to outline the philosophy behind their new “leader-follower” approach to the alliance. ', 'The sources said the companies were unlikely to disclose many details at the events this week of how the new approach will be used to share costs as the companies were still working on specific projects. ', 'However, the crisis at both carmakers has accelerated efforts to resolve the disagreements that have stymied collaboration and cost-sharing in technology and product development for five years, the sources said. ', 'Mitsubishi, Nissan and Renault all declined to comment officially about alliance plans. ', '‘LEADER-FOLLOWER’ ', 'The alliance has steadily ramped up output over the years, delivering over 10 million vehicles for the first time in 2017, the first full year after Mitsubishi joined the partnership.  ', 'But persistent quibbles over sharing the costs of innovation and new vehicle development soured relations and stalled plans to forge an even tighter alliance. ', 'Nissan executives believe their engineers are substantially more productive than their Renault colleagues and the way the French carmaker proposed to combine technology and product development did not properly account for Nissan’s intellectual property, three of the sources said.  ', '“Nissan engineers on average produced 40% more than their Renault counterparts in a given amount of time spent on a job,” one insider told Reuters in January. ', 'After his arrest in 2018 in Tokyo on charges of financial misconduct, former alliance head Ghosn said his detention was part of a plot by Nissan executives to bring him down and block any merger. ', 'Earlier this year, relations looked strained to a point where the 21-year alliance was at risk of collapse. ', 'However, the turnaround plans due are now likely to be combined to forge what the sources described as a more equitable way of sharing technology and resources, while preserving the distinctiveness of the alliance brands. ', 'Nissan Chief Operating Officer Ashwani Gupta and Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique\xa0Senard are both key advocates of the new approach that they’re calling a “leader-follower” system, the sources told Reuters. ', 'The plan is for one company to lead the development of a type of vehicle or technology with the other following, taking a page out of the play-book Gupta used to revive Renault’s commercial vehicle business, as well as reinvigorate Nissan’s. ', 'When he was in charge of the French business, Nissan used Renault’s vehicle architectures as the building blocks for its city delivery vans while Nissan in turn provided the Renault group with technology for pickup trucks. ', 'A test of the new approach could come in a several places around the world, such as how Renault and Nissan work together in Europe and perhaps South America, as well as how Nissan and Mitsubishi cooperate in Southeast Asia and Japan.  ', 'Under the new working relationship, Nissan could take the lead in Europe on crossover sport-utility vehicles (SUVs), while operating as a “follower” in commercial vans and small city cars, using versions produced by Renault, the sources said. ', 'Nissan’s factory in Sunderland in the United Kingdom is of particular importance, they said. ', 'Renault and Nissan are planning to turn the assembly plant into a hub for sport utility vehicles such as Nissan’s Qashqai and Juke, and potentially their Renault counterparts, the Kadjar and Captur. The companies are working on the plans, though it’s not clear when a final decision will be made, the sources said. ', 'Whether Renault vehicles could be built profitably at the plant is unclear, given the uncertainty over tariffs as Britain leaves the European Union, according to one of the sources.  ', '“It should be a pure economic transaction, but it’s also likely a political decision, too,” he said. ', 'In the Philippines, Mitsubishi will likely help make cars for Nissan as it already has a plant there while the two will beef up cooperation in Japan’s micro mini car business, which makes up about half the country’s passenger car market. ', 'The latest effort to salvage the Renault-Nissan alliance comes at a time of rising global economic nationalism and protectionism that represent a risk to the partnership. ', 'But for now, the new approach means the two companies will sideline any discussion of a complete merger, the sources said. Renault owns a 43.4% controlling stake in Nissan, which owns non-voting 15% stake in the French carmaker. ', '“Will merger talk be revived in the future? No one knows. Everybody has to be prepared for that.

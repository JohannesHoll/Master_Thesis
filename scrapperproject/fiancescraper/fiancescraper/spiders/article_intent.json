      "BMW said it had seen sales growth at the start of the year. Since then, the pandemic has pushed some firms, including carmakers, to halt production at some sites and many governments around the world have introduced lockdown measures in a bid to slow the spread of the virus. ",
      "\u201cBy February, the impact of the pandemic had already led to a significant decrease in sales in China. By March, the effects of the pandemic were clearly visible in sales figures in Europe and the U.S,\u201d BMW said in a statement. ",
      "BMW sales to China, where the outbreak started, were down 30.9% in the January to March period. They dropped by 18.3% in Europe and by 17.4% in the United States. ",
      "A production stoppage at BMW\u2019s factories is being extended by two weeks until April 30, a spokesman said, adding the time was being used to modify factories - a task that is keeping several thousand employees busy. ",
      "BMW is responding to an expected further downturn in demand by planning ahead and adjusting production, a spokesman said. ",
      "He added that while fundamental demand was still there, the closure of retail outlets meant customers were not ordering and receiving cars like they do normally so it would take longer for markets to recover. ",
      "BMW said around 80% of retail outlets in Europe and 70% in the United States were temporarily shut due to the pandemic.  ",
      "Shares in BMW were up 5.7% at 1023 GMT, as Europe\u2019s stock markets rebounded on hopes the region might be getting to grips with the health crisis.     ",
      "Export expectations in Germany\u2019s car sector have fallen to their lowest level since March 2009, when Europe\u2019s largest economy was in the throes of the global financial crisis, Germany\u2019s Ifo institute said on Monday. ",

      "LONDON, April 18 (Reuters) - Formula E tested a new esports \u2018Race at Home Challenge\u2019 series on Saturday with the virtual Monaco layout proving true to life as BMW i Andretti driver Maximilian Guenther won untroubled from pole position. ",
      "The regular Formula E drivers had their own race, with gamers and others competing separately in another, on simulators from their homes. ",
      "Andre Lotterer\u2019s dog made a brief appearance in the background when the camera turned to Porsche\u2019s third-placed finisher. ",
      "Mercedes driver Stoffel Vandoorne finished as runner-up, seven tenths behind, on a street circuit where overtaking is always tricky in real life. ",
      "The start was also typically chaotic and the race littered with the sort of pile-ups that would have brought out red flags in the real world, rather than a digital reset without the involvement of marshals. ",
      "Under the \u2018race royale\u2019 format, the last placed driver after each lap was eliminated until only 10 remained for a final sprint to the line. ",
      "Saturday\u2019s race was non-points scoring for the virtual series with the emphasis on familiarisation for drivers joining the fray from as far afield as Felipe Massa in Brazil. ",
      "Formula E is following other championships, such as Formula One and MotoGP, in using virtual racing to fill the void left by the COVID-19 pandemic which has brought motorsport to a standstill. ",

      "The gamers race was won by Graham Carroll for the Envision Virgin team. ",
      "The ultimate prize at stake for those competing in that category is real-life track time in a Formula E car when real-life racing resumes. ",

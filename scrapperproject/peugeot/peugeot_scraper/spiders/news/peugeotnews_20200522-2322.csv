', 'Fiat Chrysler (FCA) and French Peugeot owner PSA (', '), which have agreed a tie-up to create the world’s fourth largest carmaker, said late on Wednesday they were both withdrawing their annual dividend. That will allow them each to preserve 1.1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) in cash during the coronavirus crisis. ', 'Exor, led by Agnelli scion John Elkann and FCA’s controlling shareholder with a 28.9% stake, will miss out on around 320 million euros in cash at a time when two deals to reshape its portfolio of businesses have either been scrapped or delayed. ', 'The coronavirus crisis had already forced vehicle and equipment maker CNH Industrial (', '), also controlled by Exor, to delay to late 2021 “or beyond” a plan to split in two and list its truck, bus and engine business, which was initially due to be completed by early next year.  ', 'All eyes are now on the $50 billion FCA-PSA merger.

', 'Analysts are, however, focusing on a 5.5 billion euro special dividend FCA is set to pay to its investors just before completing the merger. ', 'Intesa Sanpaolo analyst Monica Bosio said she still expected  the payment of the special dividend, “which implicitly represents the premium assigned to the group in the deal thanks to its positioning in the U.S. and to its high-value brands such as Jeep, Ram and Maserati”. ', 'Marco Opipari, an analyst at Fidentiis, said the merger was essential to the two group’s long-term competitiveness, especially in the current scenario, but that some terms of the agreement could be rediscussed.

', 'The COVID-19 spread has hit asset valuations hard and raised questions about the terms of deals struck before the virus swept across the world.

', 'The companies have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic just as they were trying to rework their partnership following the arrest of its chief architect, Carlos Ghosn, who had been pushing for a merger despite stiff resistance from Nissan.

', 'Rivals such as Peugeot (', ') and Fiat Chrysler (', '), have been pushing ahead with plans to share costs and designs while the two biggest carmakers, Volkswagen (', ') and Toyota (', '), already operate as single units.

', 'Senard said that would help cut costs, with joint savings on future compact sports-utility vehicles (SUVs) coming to 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion). ', 'In Brazil, for example, the new approach means the alliance will go from making six models on four platforms - or underlying vehicle architectures - to seven models on one platform. ', 'A tighter design and development process at the alliance, whose best-known cars include the Renault Clio compact hatchback, the Nissan Rogue crossover SUV and the Mitsubishi Outlander SUV, would reduce it total number of models by 20% by 2025 from well over 80 now. ', 'Some analysts pointed to potential problems, however, saying the three companies remained locked in a partnership while some larger rivals were not constrained by structural limitations. ', '“The way this plan has been designed is to avoid stepping on each others’ toes, but there could be some efficiency losses, as there are boundaries they have to respect,” said Chris Richter, senior research analyst at brokerage CLSA. ', 'Renault, Nissan and junior partner Mitsubishi, which joined the alliance in 2016, have clashed previously due to differences in corporate cultures and opposing views over structures. ', 'Renault owns 43% of Nissan while it has 15% of the French carmaker but no voting rights. Nissan has resisted proposals for a full-blown merger as executives felt Renault was not paying its fair share for the engineering work it did in Japan.

Renault and Nissan, which is set to post a net loss in its latest fiscal year, are now hoping to get ahead of rivals in areas like electric vehicles.
